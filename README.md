# Mongol Rally 2013 Map

This is a an attempt at mapping the Mongol Rally 2013 route taken by Team I-Don't-Like-Dub-Steppe (a.k.a Team NAFTA), consisting of myself, my brother, and two American friends. Currently what I have is a GPX file containing the route we took, without any accidental detours, mishaps, or much in the way of details inside the cities visited. The intent is to at some point produce a high-quality map as a memento for my teammates.

The GPX file was produced by using [OpenStreetMap Routing Service](http://yournavigation.org). When I was originally putting it together, it had issues with so many waypoints, so I split the route into 3 parts and concatenated them together. The result seems to be accurate enough.

The JSON file is GeoJSON, generated from the GPX file using Mapbox's [toGeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson).

The PNG file is an example rendering from [GPS Visualizer](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com).
